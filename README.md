# Note Taker Homework 
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

For this weeks homework we were supplied starter code for a front end application that allows a user to write and save notes. For this note taker application we are required to use Node.js and Express.js to build a back end server and connect to the starter code. The application is required to store notes using a unique ID in a JSON file where they can be retreived and deleted.
